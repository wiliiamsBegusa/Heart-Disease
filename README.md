In this project i converted the categorical  data into numerical data
Correlation between data features compared using a heat map 
This is my first ml project 
In this project i used an 80/ 20 split ratio 
i also used more than one classifier but the best was the Logistic regression classifier which gave me an accuracy score of 84.78%
